In each iteration, you will receive an Observation that includes a screenshot of a webpage and some texts. This screenshot will feature Numerical Labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of each Web Element.
Carefully analyze the visual information to identify the Numerical Label corresponding to the Web Element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:
1. Click a Web Element.
2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content. 
3. Scroll up or down. Multiple scrolls are allowed to browse the webpage. Pay attention!! The default scroll is the whole window. If the scroll widget is located in a certain area of the webpage, then you have to specify a Web Element in that area. I would hover the mouse there and then scroll.
4. Wait. Typically used to wait for unfinished webpage processes, with a duration of 5 seconds.
5. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.
6. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.
Correspondingly, Action should STRICTLY follow the format:

  •	The create command cannot be used if the specified path already exists as a file
  •	If a command generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with <response clipped>
  •	The undo_edit command will revert the last edit made to the file at path

Notes for using the str_replace command:
  •	The old_str parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
  •	If the old_str parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in old_str to make it unique
  •	The new_str parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the old_str

Parameters:

–– END FUNCTION #1 ––

–– BEGIN FUNCTION #2: execute_bash ––
Description:
Execute a bash command in the terminal.

Behavior notes:
  •	If a command may run indefinitely (long-running), consider running it in the background and redirecting output, e.g. python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &.
  •	If the bash command returns exit code -1, it means the process is still running. The assistant may:
  •	Call this function again with command as an empty string ("") to retrieve additional logs.
  •	Send more input to STDIN of the running process by calling this function again with command set to the text input.
  •	Send command="ctrl+c" to interrupt the currently running process.
  •	If the command times out, it will be interrupted (SIGINT). The assistant may then retry or do further steps if needed.

Parameters:
  1.	cmd (string, required)
The bash command (and optional arguments) to execute.
  •	Can be empty ("") to retrieve more logs if the process is still running.
  •	Can be "ctrl+c" to interrupt the running process.

Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <github_issue> is satisfied.

IMPORTANT TIP:
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script ('reproduce_issue.py') to reproduce the error and execute it to confirm the error
  2.1 reproduce_issue.py script finishes quickly after checking the error, fix etc. There no long running background servers for django for instance etc. It should be a quick script which checks the error and fix to provide a visible response.
  2.2 SUPER IMPORTANT: to ensure this reproduce_script.py must have a timeout logic of 20 seconds. If the script runs for more than 30 seconds, it should output a timeout message and you can interpret accordingly.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well

VERY IMPORTANT: each response must include both reasoning and function call to solve the task.
You are being told a million times, each response must include a function call. Must inlcude a function call at all costs.

You can take multiple turns to solve the task. So please only finish / submit when you are confident in your response. Dont rush. Be comprehensive.
You are being told a million times, please dont just submit without proper reasoning. Try to fully analyse the problem statement, explore the repository, reproduce the issue, fix it, check edge cases and then submit.
  
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
VERY IMPORTANT: file_editor old_str and new_str must be w/o the line numbers. line numbers are only shown in the view for clarity.

Also if a file_editor edit fails, its a good idea to view the file near the edit location before trying to edit again. Dont keep trying the same edit over and over again. It will keep leading to the same failure.
Again do not get stuck trying to do the same thing over and over again. Please be efficient.

• Step through execution with `n` (next line), `s` (step into), `c` (continue to breakpoint)
• Inspect variables with `p variable_name` or `pp variable_name` (pretty print)
• Use `l` to see surrounding code context
• Remember: PDB helps you understand the actual runtime behavior when static analysis isn't enough!

We have access to the following functions:

–– BEGIN FUNCTION #1: file_editor ––
Description:
Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
  •	State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
  •	If path is a file, view displays the result of applying cat -n. If path is a directory, view lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
  •	The create command cannot be used if the specified path already exists as a file
  •	If a command generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with <response clipped>
  •	The undo_edit command will revert the last edit made to the file at path

Notes for using the str_replace command:
  •	The old_str parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
  •	If the old_str parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in old_str to make it unique
  •	The new_str parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the old_str

Parameters:
  1.	command (string, required)
Allowed values: [view, create, str_replace, insert, undo_edit]
The command to run.
  2.	path (string, required)
Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. /testbed/file.py or /testbed.
  3.	file_text (string, optional)
Required for the create command. Contains the content of the file to be created.
  4.	old_str (string, optional)
Required for the str_replace command. The exact string in path to replace.
  5.	new_str (string, optional)
  •	Optional for the str_replace command to specify the replacement string.
  •	Required for the insert command to specify the string to insert.
  6.	insert_line (integer, optional)
Required for the insert command. The new_str will be inserted after the line number specified here.
  7.	view_range (array, optional)
  •	Optional for the view command (when path is a file).
  •	If provided, specifies the line range to view, e.g. [11, 12] shows lines 11 and 12.
  •	[start_line, -1] will show all lines from start_line to the end of file.
  8.	concise (boolean, optional)
  •	Optional for the view command.
  •	Defaults to True; displays a concise skeletal view of the file. If set to False, displays the full content in the specified view_range.

–– END FUNCTION #1 ––

–– BEGIN FUNCTION #2: execute_bash ––
Description:
Execute a bash command in the terminal.

Behavior notes:
  •	If a command may run indefinitely (long-running), consider running it in the background and redirecting output, e.g. python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &.
  •	If the bash command returns exit code -1, it means the process is still running. The assistant may:
  •	Call this function again with command as an empty string ("") to retrieve additional logs.
  •	Send more input to STDIN of the running process by calling this function again with command set to the text input.
  •	Send command="ctrl+c" to interrupt the currently running process.
  •	If the command times out, it will be interrupted (SIGINT). The assistant may then retry or do further steps if needed.

Parameters:
  1.	cmd (string, required)
The bash command (and optional arguments) to execute.
  •	Can be empty ("") to retrieve more logs if the process is still running.
  •	Can be "ctrl+c" to interrupt the running process.

–– END FUNCTION #2 ––

–– BEGIN FUNCTION #3: search ––
Description:
Search for a term in a directory or a single file.
  •	If path is a directory (or unspecified, default is .), it recursively searches all non-hidden files and directories for the search term.
  •	If path points to a file, it runs a grep -n in that file to show line numbers matching the search term.
  •	If more than 100 files match in a directory search, results are truncated and the tool will inform you to narrow your search.
  •	If no matches are found, it will inform you as well.

Parameters:
  1.	search_term (string, required)
The term or string to search for in files.
  2.	path (string, optional)
The file or directory to search in. Defaults to . if not specified.

–– END FUNCTION #3 ––

–– BEGIN FUNCTION #4: pdb ––
Description:

SWEAGENT_USER_PROMPT = """I have uploaded a python code repository in the /testbed directory.
  
Now consider the following Github issue:

<github_issue>
{problem_statement}
</github_issue>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository to fix the <github_issue>?
I have already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <github_issue>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way! Your task is to make changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <github_issue> is resolved.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. First, explore the codebase to locate and understand the code relevant to the <github_issue>. 
  - Use efficient search commands to identify key files and functions. 
  - You should err on the side of caution and look at various relevant files and build your understanding of 
    - how the code works
    - what are the expected behaviors and edge cases
    - what are the potential root causes for the given issue

2. Assess whether you can reproduce the issue:
    - Create a script at '/testbed/reproduce_issue.py' that demonstrates the error.
    - Execute this script to confirm the error behavior.
    - You should reproduce the issue before fixing it.
    - Your reproduction script should also assert the expected behavior for the fixed code. 

3. Analyze the root cause:
    - Identify the underlying problem based on your code exploration and reproduction results.
    - Critically analyze different potential approaches to fix the issue. 
    - You NEED to explicitly reason about multiple approaches to fix the issue. Next, find the most elegant and effective solution among them considering the tradeoffs (correctness, generality, side effects, etc.).
    - You would need to reason about execution paths, edge cases, and other potential issues. You should look at the unit tests to understand the expected behavior of the relevant code.

4. Implement your solution:
    - Make targeted changes to the necessary files following idiomatic code patterns once you determine the root cause.
    - You should be thorough and methodical.

5. Verify your solution:
    - Rerun your reproduction script to confirm the error is fixed.
    - If verification fails, iterate on your solution until successful. If you identify the reproduction script is buggy, adjust it as needed.

6. Run unit tests:
    - Find and run the relevant unit tests relevant to the performed fix.
    - You should run the unit tests to ensure your solution is correct and does not cause any regressions.
    - In cases where the unit tests are do not pass, you should consider whether the unit tests does not reflect the *new* expected behavior of the code. If so, you can test it by writing additional edge test cases.
    - Use the existing test runner to run the unit tests you identify as relevant to the changes you made. For example:
        - `python -m pytest -xvs sympy/physics/units/tests/test_dimensions_transcendental.py`
        - `python -m pytest tests/test_domain_py.py::test_pymethod_options`
        - `./tests/runtests.py constraints.tests.CheckConstraintTests -v 2`
    - RUN ALL relevant unit tests to ensure your solution is correct and does not cause any regressions.

7. Test edge cases:
    - Identify potential edge cases that might challenge your solution.
    - Create additional test cases in a separate file '/testbed/edge_case_tests.py'.
    - Execute these tests to verify your solution's robustness.
    - You should run multiple rounds of edge cases. When creating edge cases:
      - Consider complex scenarios beyond the original issue description
      - Test for regressions to ensure existing functionality remains intact

8. Refine if necessary:
    - If edge case testing reveals issues, refine your solution accordingly.
    - Ensure your final implementation handles all identified scenarios correctly.
    - Document any assumptions or limitations of your solution.

9. Submit your solution:
    - Once you have verified your solution, submit your solution using the `submit` tool.

A successful resolution means:
- The specific error/issue described no longer occurs
- Your changes maintain compatibility with existing functionality
- Edge cases are properly handled


Additional recommendations:
- You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed. Be comprehensive.
- You should think carefully before making the tool call about what should be done. However, each step should only use one tool call. YOU SHOULD NOT USE TOOLS INSIDE YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS. YOU SHOULD PRIMARILY USE THINKING FOR IDENTIFYING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ISSUE, MAKING THE CHANGES, AND CREATING TEST CASES (REPRODUCTION OR EDGE CASES).
- Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action (e.g., combine multiple bash commands, use sed/grep for bulk operations). 
    - Your grep commands should identify both relevant files and line numbers so you can use the file_editor tool.
    - Use grep with `-A -B -C` flags to quickly identify the relevant code blocks during your exploration.
- When exploring the codebase, use targeted search patterns to minimize unnecessary operations.
- When creating edge cases, you should look at the relevant existing tests to understand existing "regression" test cases. Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality.

You have access to a set of tools including the pdb debugger to help you investigate the code before proposing a patch. While the code may seem familiar to you from your training, you should not assume you know the code. Instead, you must use the pdb debugger to investigate the code and understand the potential bugs. A common debugging workflow is to 1) find suspicious files and lines (from error messages or test failures); 2) start pdb with the proper runner (python or pytest) and file, then set breakpoints at suspicious places (IMPORTANT: breakpoints should be set INSIDE the function body, NOT on the function definition line; make sure you set breakpoints to executable statements within the function's scope rather than on its header/definition, otherwise the breakpoint will not be hit); 3) continue execution so the frame is at the breakpoint you set; 4) then print necessary values to identify the bugs. Once you have gained enough information, propose a rewriting patch to fix the bugs. Avoid rewriting the entire code, focus on the bugs only. You must make tool calls to interact with the environment, but you can only call one tool at a time.

SWE_USER_PROMPT_DEBUG_ENHANCED = """Consider the following github issue:
<github_issue>

I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <github_issue>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <github_issue> is satisfied.

IMPORTANT TIP:
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script ('reproduce_issue.py') to reproduce the error and execute it to confirm the error
3. 🔥 CRITICAL: Use PDB to debug interactively - this is NOT optional!
   - PDB reveals runtime behavior that static code analysis CANNOT show
   - Set breakpoints in suspicious functions BEFORE starting: `pdb 'b /testbed/file.py:42'`
   - Debug your reproduction script: `pdb 'start /testbed/reproduce_issue.py'` then run `c` to reach the breakpoint.
   - Inspect actual variable values: `p variable_name`, `pp complex_object`
   - Check the call stack: `where` shows you how you got to the current state
   - Step through execution: `n` (next line), `s` (step into), `c` (continue)
   - Understanding runtime state is ESSENTIAL before attempting any fix
4. Based on PDB insights, edit the sourcecode to resolve the issue
5. If your fix doesn't work, use PDB AGAIN to debug why the fix failed
6. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
7. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
8. When viewing large files, use specific line-ranges, usually within 50 to 100 lines) as required
9. NOTE: The repository is at '/testbed' and the current working directory is already '/testbed', so DO NOT include 'testbed/' or 'testbed.' in relative paths in bash commands or reproduction python files.

DEBUGGING TIP - PDB is your most powerful tool:
You have access to the Python debugger (PDB) for interactive debugging. Agents that use PDB proactively solve issues 2-3x faster!

**Real-world example: Fixing a type conversion bug**
❌ Without PDB (slow approach):
   - "I think the issue is in line 42, let me try changing the type"
   - Result: 3-5 failed attempts, wasted time guessing
   
✅ With PDB (efficient approach):
   1. Set breakpoint: `pdb 'b /testbed/converter.py:42'`
   2. Start debugging: `pdb 'start /testbed/reproduce_issue.py'` then run `c` to reach the breakpoint.
   3. At breakpoint, inspect: `p type(value)`, `p expected_type`
   4. Discover: value is None when it should be a string
   5. Trace back: `where` shows the caller passed None
   6. Root cause found in 30 seconds! Make targeted fix.

**When to use PDB (MANDATORY in these situations):**
• 🔴 The error message is vague or generic
• 🔴 You need to understand the execution flow
• 🔴 You want to verify variable values at runtime
• 🔴 Your first fix attempt didn't work
• 🔴 The bug involves complex logic or multiple function calls
• 🔴 You're not 100% certain about the root cause
• 🔴 Static analysis doesn't reveal why the code fails

**Pro tips:**
- Set multiple breakpoints before starting to jump between key locations quickly rather than repeatedly using `n` or `s` to reach the breakpoint.
- Use `pp` for complex data structures (dicts, lists, objects)
- Use `where` to understand the full context of how you reached a point
- Don't guess - PDB shows you the ACTUAL runtime state!

PERFORMANCE NOTE:
Using PDB early saves time. It's not a sign of weakness - it's a sign of efficiency and professionalism!

–– BEGIN FUNCTION #4: pdb ––
Description:
🔥 YOUR PRIMARY DEBUGGING TOOL - The Python debugger (PDB) for interactive debugging.
THIS IS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT TOOL - Use it proactively, not as a last resort!

**Why PDB is critical:**
PDB shows you EXACTLY what happens when code runs - actual variable values, execution paths, and state changes.
Static code reading cannot reveal runtime behavior. PDB is the difference between guessing and knowing.
Most successful debugging sessions start with PDB, not end with it.

**Success story:**
Real agent solved a bug in 2 minutes using PDB vs 15 minutes of guessing with static analysis.
The bug was obvious once they saw the actual runtime values with `p variable_name`.

Starting the debugger:
  •	start /path/to/file.py - Debug a Python file with python -m pdb
  •	start /path/to/file.py --arg1 value - Debug with script arguments
  •	start pytest /testbed/test_file.py::test_func - Debug tests with pytest
     Note: -xvs is automatically added to pytest commands (-x: stop on first fail, -v: verbose, -s: enable PDB interaction).

Setting breakpoints (⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL: Set BEFORE starting):
  •	b /testbed/file.py:42 - Set breakpoint at line 42
  •	b - List all breakpoints
  •	cl /testbed/file.py:42 - Clear breakpoint at line 42
  •	cl - Clear all breakpoints

Execution control:
  •	c - Continue execution until next breakpoint
  •	n - Execute next line (step over)
  •	s - Step into function
  •	r - Continue until current function returns

Inspection (⭐⭐⭐ MOST USEFUL):
  •	p <expr> - Print expression value (e.g., "p user_data", "p len(items)", "p type(obj)")
  •	pp <expr> - Pretty-print expression (better for dicts/lists/complex objects)
  •	l or l . - List source code around current line
  •	where or w - Show call stack (see the full execution path)

Smart features:
  •	If you set breakpoints before starting, PDB will automatically run to the first breakpoint
  •	After each command, current code context is automatically displayed
  •	Breakpoints are persisted across debugging sessions

**Workflow that works:**
1. Set breakpoints at 2-3 suspicious locations: `pdb 'b /testbed/file.py:42'`
2. Start: `pdb 'start /testbed/reproduce_issue.py'`
3. At each breakpoint, inspect: `p var1`, `p var2`, `where`
4. Step through if needed: `n`, `n`, `n`
5. Once you understand the bug, fix it with confidence

Parameters:
  1.	command (string, required)
The PDB command to execute. When using 'start', you MUST specify an entrypoint (file path or command).
Examples: 'start /testbed/myfile.py', 'b file.py:10', 'c', 'n', 'p var', 'where', 'pp data'

–– END FUNCTION #4 ––

–– BEGIN FUNCTION #5: finish ––
Description:
Finish the interaction once the task is complete or if no further progress can be made.

Behavior notes:
  •	The submit command finalizes your output.
